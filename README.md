Moved to rubin-sim-data

Note, this repo contains template spectra downloaded from the ESO sky brightness calculator (http://www.eso.org/observing/etc/bin/gen/form?INS.MODE=swspectr+INS.NAME=SKYCALC).  The code for calling and packaging the data can be found in the sims_skybrightness repo.  This separation is so the large files can be isolated and easily updated/deleted without disrupting the commit history of the code.
